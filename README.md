## TDD Examples

This repository is just for training.

Test driven development is the practice of writing a failing test (unit or functional or whatever..) before writing the code that will make the test pass. It gives you a goal to work at, and forces you to think about how accessible your code is. It can also be used to gain confidence within your codebase.

The purpose is to learn and train.
